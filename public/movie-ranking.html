<h2>Top 3 Movies for various genres</h2>
<hr \>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<h4>Spirited Away</h4>
<p>All time classic. Beautiful music accompanied with the most beautiful scenery. One of the best animation done by Studio Ghibli</p>
<h4>Garden of Words</h4>
<p>One of my personal favourites. Also a very short film with only 40 minutes of watch time. The story and animation are very captivating.</p>
<h4>Ponyo</h4>
<p>Another Studio Ghibli movie, but with its own very unique charm. Always a pleasure to rewatch, you can't do anything wrong with it.</p>
